# AR.IO Network Discussions

Welcome to the AR.IO Networkâ€™s technical forum.

This space is for **deep technical discussion** around the design, architecture, and evolution of the AR.IO protocol and its components - including the smart contract, AO integrations, gateway infrastructure, ArNS, staking mechanics, and incentive structures.

**Important:** Posting here does **not** initiate a formal proposal or governance process. Contributions are public, permanent, and visible to the broader ecosystem, but there is no guarantee that they will be reviewed, discussed, or adopted.

## Appropriate Topics

Discussions here are best suited for:

- Protocol and smart contract design
- Network incentive structures and staking mechanisms
- ArNS pricing model, ANT evolution, or name system dynamics
- Gateway architectural decisions or modularity tradeoffs
- Observability, performance metrics, and protocol incentives

This is **not** the place for:
- How-to questions or troubleshooting (please use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HGG52EtTc2) for support)
- Feature requests without deep technical framing
- Non-technical posts

---

## How to Use

- Use GitHub **Discussions** to start a topic with clear context and rationale.
- One topic per thread is best - give it a descriptive title.
- Keep tone constructive and focused on reasoning, architecture, and implementation.
