# AR.IO Network Discussions

Welcome to the AR.IO Networkâ€™s technical forum.

This space is for **deep, protocol-level discussion** around the design and architecture of the AR.IO Network - including the smart contract, AO integration, gateway infrastructure, ArNS, staking mechanics, reward logic, and observation systems.

> **Note:** Posting here does **not** initiate a governance process. Discussions are public and permanent but are not guaranteed to be reviewed, responded to, or adopted.
